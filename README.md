# AllyZabbaCart
Wordpress Shopping Cart Plugin based on Cart66Pro with enhancements as seen on AllyZabba.com

This is an informal branch of the Cart66 Pro software and is not offered with support. That said, there are a
number of useful features present which others are welcome to use and build on. 

For example:
  1. Leverages the User system for multiple pricing levels (memberships)
  2. Integration with Endicia (works perfectly on a Mac running Safari, others untested)
  3. Promotions can be targetted at certain membership levels, or only unregistered guests
  4. Integration with Sendy as another option for mailing lists.
  5. A number of bug fixes and a number of default preference changes.
