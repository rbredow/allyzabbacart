# AllyZabba Cart
Wordpress Shopping Cart Plugin based on Cart66Pro with enhancements as seen on AllyZabba.com

This is an informal branch of the Cart66 Pro software and is offered without support. Cart66 Pro is an open source commercial Wordpress Plugin and well worth the small investment to buy and get support from them. That said, there are a number of useful features present in this branch which you may find useful.

For example:
  1. Leverages the User system for multiple pricing levels (memberships)
  2. Integration with Endicia (works perfectly on a Mac running Safari, others untested)
  3. Promotions can be targetted at certain membership levels, or only unregistered guests
  4. Integration with Sendy as another option for mailing lists.
  5. A number of bug fixes and a number of default preference changes.

As of 12/29/15, this version tracks to the current release of Cart66 Pro. Integrations have been without conflict for a couple of years.
